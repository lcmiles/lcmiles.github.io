            <p>I am a junior-level computer science student passionate about technology and software development. I am currently
                pursuing my degree in Computer Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham as a part of the Honors
                Program. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java,
                Python, C, ASM, and MATLAB. I have a keen interest in web development, game development, algorithms, and
                problem-solving. I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills in various areas of computer science.</p>
            <p id="1">While my focus is on academics, I also have a deep appreciation for PC Gaming and building custom PCs. I
                enjoy assembling hardware components, optimizing performance, and staying up-to-date with the latest
                advancements in the world of computer hardware. In my free time, you can find me gaming or exploring the
                latest trends in the tech world. I believe that a well-rounded approach to life enhances creativity and
                problem-solving skills, and I look forward to applying these principles in my future endeavors. Feel free
                to connect with me if you share similar interests or have exciting projects to collaborate on!</p>
